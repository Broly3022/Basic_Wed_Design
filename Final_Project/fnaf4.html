            <p>
                Five Nights at Freddy's 4" (FNAF 4) delves into the unsettling and mysterious origins of the animatronic horror. The game is set in a child's bedroom and presents a unique perspective, with players taking on the role of a young child who must survive the night against nightmare versions of Freddy Fazbear and his friends. The lore revolves around the 'Bite of '83,' an incident where a child was bitten by one of the animatronics, leading to a severe injury and a haunting memory for the protagonist. Throughout the game, cryptic mini-games and unsettling events gradually unveil the harrowing backstory of the Fazbear franchise, its connection to the child's traumatic experiences, and the malevolent presence known as the 'Purple Guy,' all contributing to the ever-expanding narrative web of the Five Nights at Freddy's universe</p>
